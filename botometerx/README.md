# Introduction

This folder contains a Jupyter notebook to demonstrate how to query the Botometer X API.

# Preparation

To use the API, you need a free [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/hub) account and subscribe to one of the [plans of Botometer](https://rapidapi.com/OSoMe/api/botometer-pro/pricing).

You can copy paste your RapidAPI key to the file `api_key.json.template` and then rename it to `api_key.json`.

We will use the [botometer Python package](https://github.com/osome-iu/botometer-python) for the demonstration.

You can install the package with the following command:

```bash
pip install botometer
```
