    "The aim is to identify all elements that fulfill a semantic role in relation to this verb and to determine their specific roles, such as Agent, Patient, or Instrument, as well as their adjuncts, like Locative, Temporal, or Manner. For instance, in the sentence \"Mary sold the book to John,\" the verb predicate is \"sold.\" Here, \"Mary\" acts as the agent of the predicate, performing the action on \"the book,\" which is transferred to the recipient \"John.\" The diversity of sentence structures makes Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) a fascinating and challenging task."
