For instance, in the sentence \"Mary sold the book to John,\" the verb predicate is \"sold.\" Here, \"Mary\" acts as the agent of the predicate, performing the action on \"the book,\" which is transferred to the recipient \"John.\" The diversity of sentence structures makes Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) a fascinating and challenging task."
