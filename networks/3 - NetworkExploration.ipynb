      " 'Both the “black jobs” remark and using palestinian as a slur are hopefully clarifying as to actual Trump’s ideology and worldview, in contrast with the imaginary trump some people have built up in their heads as the memory of his administration has receded'\n",
      " 'Weirdly Van Jones had the best summary: Biden stuttered but told the truth, Trump was confident and lied endlessly'\n",
      " 'Trump tells his rally crowd Chuck Schumer has “become a Palestinian.” Second time this week he’s used “Palestinian” to describe non-Palestinians he dislikes as if the word is a slur.\\n\\nI remain skeptical of the claim that Trump becoming president next year would improve the lives of Palestinians.'\n",

      " 'The story of Election 2024 is obviously “will the villainous Trump return to destroy democracy once and for all?” Almost no one - Republicans included - denies this narrative. But the media’s refusal to participate makes it feel more out of “narrative integrity” than journalistic.']\n"
