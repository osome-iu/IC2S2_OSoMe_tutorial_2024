## TopFIBers
### What does a FIB index represent?

The FIB index is intended to capture the influence that a social media account has with respect to spreading low-credibility content. The FIB index focuses on problematic **repeat offenders** by capturing the consistency with which a user shares low-credibility content on a given platform during a period of time.
Repurpose the _h_-index, which was originally developed to measure the influence of scholars. 
- The _h_-index of a scholar is defined as the maximum value of _h_ such that they have at least _h_ papers, each with at least _h_ citations.
- Similarly, in the context of social media: a user with a FIB index of 100 means that the user has shared at least 100 posts linking to low-credibility sources, each of which has been reshared at least 100 times. On the other hand, a user who posts only one post linking to a low-credibility source will have a FIB index of one, even if it was reshared millions of times.
